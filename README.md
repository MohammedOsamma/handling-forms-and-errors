# 🧪 React Form Handling & Validation

This repo explores different techniques for handling forms and validation in React – step by step.

---

## 🟡 useState  
Basic controlled components.  
Each input is linked to its own state.

---

## 🟢 useState + Generic Handlers  
Simplify input handling using one `onChange` function for all fields.

---

## 🔵 useRef  
Access input values without binding to state.  
Useful for fast access and form submission.

---

## 📤 FormData  
Get all input values at once using the `FormData` API from the form element.

---

## 🔁 Reset Form  
Reset form fields manually or via the `FormData` approach.

---

## 🧠 OnBlur Validation  
Validate each field when the user leaves it (on blur).  
Generic validation logic for scalability.

---

## 🧪 Submit Validation (with Refs)  
Trigger validation only when the form is submitted using `Refs`.

---

## 🛠️ Native Validation  
Use HTML built-in attributes like `required`, `minLength`, etc.

---

## ♻️ Reusable Input Component  
Create a flexible `<Input />` component for consistent UI & behavior.

---

## 📦 Outsourced Validation  
Move validation logic into separate functions/hooks for cleaner code.
